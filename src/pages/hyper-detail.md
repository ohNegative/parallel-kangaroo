#### Project Overview

The owner was opening his new business the second week of February and wanted the site to go live by then. I literally had less than a month to write all the content, grab a design for the site and get it released. Even with a static site and less than 20 pages of content, this was a daunting task. Add in the fact I was going to be doing this while working a full-time job during the day.

Once I started on the site, Brandon mentioned he needed a logo for his company and asked me to handle that as well.

#### Project Successes

In the four weeks I was given, I was able to write 10 pages of content, grab a design, create a logo, and then code the site up and get it released. I was also able to get the site completely optimized for SEO and got Google analytics set up as well. I used Netlify for the hosting. Netlify also handled the two contact forms on the site. The source control for the site was done in a private github repo on my account; so maintaining the site and making updates will be easy. Netlify give me the ability to have continuous deployment functionality, so getting the site updated quickly is easy.

The site was released on Feb 3rd. I made subsequent updates to SEO and analytics to better focus on a broader audience. The owner was elated when the site was released on time and under budget (I did everything for free) and is already generated around 3-5 leads per week for the business.
