### Technologies Used

> AngularJS 1.x., AEM CMS, Bootstrap framework

***

#### Project Background

This was a massive project which entailed 18 teams, 36 months of work and north of $18 million dollars.

#### Project Overivew

This project was a full blown re-write of the existing UHC Tricare Military website. The original website was built on Spring MVC with a standard HTML5/CSS3 front-end.

The new design would still have some elements of Spring while leveraging a modified (read: not extended) bootstrap 3 front-end coupled with Angular JS (ver. 1.4) for many of the front-end components. Optum hired an external design firm to design the site and create a design library that would be the foundation for the majority of the front-end components. We also utilized Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) for the content management system.

Overall this architecture worked well since the developers could build the components with AngularJS and Bootstrap and then add them to AEM where the content authors could then modify or change the content to what their needs would be.

This was a massive project. We had over eighteen teams working together on a single codebase.

#### My Project Work


* Redesigned the largest form on the site to be more mobile compliant - the current design failed to meet Optum's mobile requirements.
* Worked with the 3rd party vendor to take over managing the front-end design library.
* Created a time-out script with a modal that had several complex requirements and was for a specific set of pages.
* Worked with the analytics team to get Adobe Dyanmic Tagging functionality integrated in the site.
* Was moved to the architecture team to help them deal with several front-end issues.
* Worked with the content team with adding authorable content in AEM.
* Was the only front-end developer on the architecture team.
* Created a browser notification for browser versions we don't support for the five major browsers as well as a long list of mobile browser versions.

#### Project Successes


* First large scale, fully agile project that was successful at Optum.
* Excellent collaboration between the 15+ teams that were all working on the portal at the same time.
* Launched successfully with only a handful of backend issues. Initially the launch saw no front-end issues.
* First major project that used Angular JS coupled with AEM to successfully build a portal site.
