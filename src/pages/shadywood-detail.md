### Technologies Used

> Custom Squarespace template design, Squarespace for the content management and SEO.

***

#### Project Overview

I was initially making small tweaks to the site, and working on their SEO. Three years ago, the owner decided to retire, and his son took over the business. We continued with the older design for about a year, and then Mike decided to make wholesale changes to the website. He really wanted to lean on the website to create a lot more leads and improve the design. At the time, they were paying Yellow Pages quite a bit of money each month to do their SEO and create videos for the site to boast their content. The old site was built on a responsive Wordpress theme.

#### Project Goal

The design process was a long one, but worth it. We went through all the options. From a static hosted site on Netlify, to many, many content management frameworks like Wordpress and Drupal. Mike wanted the ability to add content on a regular basis. Paramount to Mike was the ability for anybody in their office to add content.

In the end, we decided on Squarespace. They host the site, and using their CMS is a breeze. We put together a very straight forward design, with a focus on the content to boost their SEO. They already had a lot of blog posts, so getting everything transferred over to Squarespace was a lot of work on the front end. I made a point to keep the UI/UX as simple as possible. Not a lot of interactive elements. Not a lot of flashy animations. There was a specific focus on the content. Get the user to the content they want, get them to the contact page, and get as many conversions as possible.

#### Timetable and Release

Since we were moving platforms, it was easy to take our time with the design process while still maintaining the existing site. We were designing in parallel, copying a lot of the content over to the new design, getting a lot of the SEO locked in and still having time to create new content. The other thing Mike wanted to have was a rock-solid analytics framework so we could really trace how successful the site was. We settled on Google analytics combined with Squarespace’s own analytics which would allow us to track a lot of things and be able to compare both to get a clearer picture of what was happening on the site.

The time table was open for the sake of getting this right the first time. Mike didn’t want to release the site and spend several months adding things or messing with the design anymore. The strategy was to get the site designed, get the content moved over and then have a runway to start adding content on a regular basis. Overall, it took around 16 months before we really felt the site was ready to be released.

#### Project Successes

Over a weekend in the Winter, we swapped the domain over and lit the site up. It was a seamless process and within about an hour, the site was live with the new design. Over the next year, we added content nearly every month. The site started dominating the SERP’s (search engine result pages) and the leads started flooding in. In the first year, the site generated over 350 leads and doubled that the following year. The site went from about 5% of the company’s revenue’s to almost 15% in the span of 36 months.
