#### Project Overview

Because of the speed with which we can get a portal up and running, the timeframe was set to be just under 8 months from beginning to full release. The technology was older, but we were still using Spring MVC on the backend. The front end was very straight forward. Most of the content was in a custom enterprise CMS that contained the CSS, and then the snippets of the content. The portals werenâ€™t responsive, so the CSS was straight forward. Fluid yes, responsive? Nope. 

Since my manager knew I had UI/UX design experience, I was working both as a designer and a developer. By doing souble duty, I was able to craft a design which would work best with the default layouts and templates of the CMS we were using. The design was simple and straight forward and the business owners wanted to focus instead on the direct functionality instead of designing something that was visually impressive. 

#### Project Successes

I was able to get all the front-end work done in a few months. I crafted a majority of the design and created many of the UI/UX elements which were reusable. I was also able to work with the project leads to also get additional functionality that was needed including breadcrumbs and responsive tables for the data applications. The portal was launched on time, under budget and with only a few minor bugs.
