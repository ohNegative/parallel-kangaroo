#### Project Overview

This project started as a simple SEO optimization project, that morphed into a full blown redesign. The design process took almost 6 months of plowing through multiple iterations of the design before landing on the final version. Another six to hammer out all the custom functionality, create and develop the custom theme. The last six months was really tinkering with the performance and SEO to get everything exactly right. The end product was a stunning visual representation of their work. The new design was received very well from their clients and continues to rank high in the SERP's. 

The project had an ongoing, open ended schedule. The partners were more concerned with getting the design and functionality right without cutting any corners because of time. This allowed many iterations of the design and functionality to occur over a longer period of time.
