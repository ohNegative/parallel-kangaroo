#### Project Overview

XPS is owned by Can-Am, a small division with BRP. The site had been around for a while but wasn't be utilized at all by their customers. They wanted to have a full dealer site with product listings, and downloadable safety and maintenance information as well as a dealer locator app so customers could find the nearest dealer to buy their products.

We set the site up as an MVC4 project and then was able to use XML data for a simple database for their product pages which then worked well for the search functionality. It would make maintaining the site and the products relatively easy and give some added functionality they didn't have previously. Another nice feature was the French-Canadian translation since XPS has a large presence in Canada. Lastly, we were able to add a media page for them which included several youtube videos and downloadable FAQ's in PDF form.

The redesign and dealer locator integration werenâ€™t seen as a permanent solution since they were already planning a full overhaul of the site within the next year anyways. Since this more of a patch to get them to the next full redesign, we were able to get the site redesigned, built, tested and released in less than three months. Well under the six-month time- table they had given us and well under budget.
